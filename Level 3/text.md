# Project 5: Time Series Forecasting for Stock Prices

## Description
In this project, we use historical stock prices of TCS to build a time series forecasting model. The goal is to predict future stock prices using models like ARIMA(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). We evaluate the accuracy of the forecast and analyze the results.

### Steps:
- Data Collection: Gather historical stock price data from sources like Kaggle.
- Time Series Analysis: Analyze the stock price data, decompose trends, and check for stationarity.
- Model Building:
  - ARIMA: Build an ARIMA model and fine-tune its parameters (p, d, q).
  - LSTM: Implement an LSTM model for forecasting using deep learning techniques.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

### Skills Covered:
- Time series analysis (decomposition, stationarity)
- ARIMA modeling and hyperparameter tuning
- LSTM model implementation and evaluation
- Forecast accuracy assessment

# Project 6: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

## Description
In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on social media data (e.g., tweets) to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. We use libraries like TextBlob to process the text data, clean it, and perform sentiment classification.

### Steps:
- Data Collection: Collect social media data (e.g., tweets) using Kaggle
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing stopwords, special characters, and applying tokenization.
- Sentiment Classification:
  - TextBlob: Use TextBlob for basic sentiment analysis.
  - NLTK: Implement more advanced NLP techniques using NLTK, such as text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Sentiment Analysis: Classify the sentiment of each post as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Skills Covered:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- Sentiment analysis: Using libraries like TextBlob and NLTK for classification.
- Data cleaning: Handling text data for analysis.
