# Project 1: Simple Data Analytics - Sales Data Analysis

## Description
In this project, we analyze a small dataset of sales data from a retail store. The primary focus is on understanding basic concepts of data cleaning, performing descriptive statistics, and creating visualizations. We use visualizations such as **bar charts** and **pie charts** to gain insights into sales distribution and trends.

### Steps:
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand the data distribution.
- Visualizations:
  - Bar Charts: Used to show sales distribution by categories (e.g., sales by region, product type).
  - Pie Charts: Display the proportion of different categories in the dataset.

### Skills Covered:
- Data cleaning
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.)
- Python

# Project 2: Linear Regression on Simple Dataset

## Description
In this project, we build a linear regression model using a simple dataset. The goal is to predict sales based on advertising spend. We explore the relationship between the independent variable (advertising spend) and the dependent variable (sales), and develop a linear regression model to make predictions.

### Steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for modeling, handle missing values, and ensure the features are appropriately scaled.
- Model Building: Use Scikit-learn to build a simple linear regression model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Skills Covered:
- Understanding of regression analysis
- Implementing linear regression using Python and the Scikit-learn library
- Evaluating model performance and accuracy
