# Project 3: Data Analytics - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## Description
In this project, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to analyze and understand the dataset's structure, identify missing values, examine the distribution of key features, and explore relationships between variables. We also use **basic visualizations** such as histograms and correlation heatmaps to identify patterns and insights in the data.

### Steps:
- Data Wrangling: Handle missing values, clean up the data, and prepare it for analysis.
- Feature Distribution: Analyze the distribution of various features like age, sex, and passenger class.
- Correlations: Use correlation heatmaps to examine relationships between numerical variables.
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms: Used to visualize the distribution of continuous variables like age, fare, etc.
  - Correlation Heatmaps: Show relationships between numerical features in the dataset.

### Skills Covered:
- Data wrangling (handling missing values and data cleaning)
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Basic understanding of statistics (distribution, correlation analysis)

# Project 4: Classification - Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset

## Description
In this project, we build a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, based on various features like age, sex, and class. The goal is to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors using a classification model. We perform **feature engineering**, train the model, and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

### Steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale the data for logistic regression.
- Model Building: Use Scikit-learn to build a logistic regression model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

### Skills Covered:
- Classification techniques: Understanding and implementing logistic regression.
- Model evaluation*: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Feature engineering: Creating useful features for the model, including handling categorical variables.
